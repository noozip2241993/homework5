Read a text file named “book.txt” that may have multiple lines. Then create a “summary.txt”
file that has the frequency of each letter, case-insensitive, i.e., “a” and “A” are the same letter.
Each line has a record of the letter and frequency.The last line should be a summary to tell if
the file has all 26 letters.
